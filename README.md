# Morse Code Encoder/Decoder

This is a simple Python-based Morse code encoder and decoder. The program allows users to input either a string of text or Morse code, and it will convert the input to the opposite format (from text to Morse code, or from Morse code to text).

## Features
- **Encode**: Convert plain text (letters, numbers, and space) into Morse code.
- **Decode**: Convert Morse code back into plain text.
- **Supports**: Lowercase and uppercase letters (both treated the same), numbers (0-9), and spaces.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**: 
   Simply run the script, and you'll be prompted to either encode or decode a message.

2. **Encoding**:
   - To encode a message, input any combination of letters, numbers, or spaces.
   - The program will convert the message into Morse code, with each Morse code symbol separated by a space.

3. **Decoding**:
   - To decode a Morse code message, input a string of Morse code symbols. Symbols should be separated by spaces.
   - The program will convert the Morse code back into the original message.

4. **Exit**:
   - To exit the program, type `#` when prompted.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x is recommended).
2. Copy the code from `morse_code.py` (or your script) into a Python file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
4. Run the program using:
   
   ```bash
   python morse_code.py
